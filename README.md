Hi, 
I am currently pursuing a Master's degree in Computer Science from San Jose State Universtiy (2021 - 2023)
I have a bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering and almost 3 years of full--time work experience in backend software development. I spent a majority of my time developing microservices and RESTful APIs.
I interned at Meta at their Menlo Park office this summer, of 2022, as a full stack software engineer working on an internal metrics' product.
Currently, I am looking for Spring 2023 full-time SWE opportunities.
