Hi, 
I am a software engineer who likes to build cool stuff.. I have 4.5 years of full-time work experience in full-stack, mainly backend, cloud, devops, etc. I spent the majority of my time developing microservices and RESTful APIs.


Have a Master's degree in Computer Science from San Jose State Universtiy (2021 - 2023) and a bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering.

I interned at Meta at their Menlo Park office this summer, of 2022, as a full stack software engineer working on an internal metrics' product.

If you have any exciting SWE midlevel roles, hit me up..
